[PRONUNCIATION GUIDE]
/start

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS FOR BRITTISH PRONUNCIATION, AMERICAN PRONUNCIATION WILL PROBABLY COME LATER (Although I have tried to make it as easy to follow as I can).
`a` - *a*sh
`√§` - c*a*r - This letter can change your spelling depending on how you pronounce the word. E.g. "b√§th" / "bath"
`b` - *b*ug
`c` - *ch*air - This does not make the regular `/k/` sound. It now makes a "ch" sound.
`d` - *d*oor
`e` - *e*gg
`√´` - *y*es - Replaces the letter "y".
`f` - *f*ig
`g` - *g*irl
`h` - *h*ill
`i` - *i*nto - makes the "i" sound.
`√Ø` - tr*ee* - makes the very common "ee" sound.
`j` - *j*ug
`k` - *c*at - Any `k` replaces `c` in English only if it makes the `/k/` sound. words like "concept" would be spelt like "konsept" in i≈ãgliks.
`l` - *l*ike
`m` - *m*ove
`n` - *n*ice
`≈ã` - thi*n*g - This letter is one of those nasal sounds like `m` and `n`.
`o` - g*o*ld - Makes that `o` diphthong for all you american idiots. Your old `o` sound has been replaced with `√§`, have fun :).
`√∂` - *or* - Literally makes the `or` sound.
`p` - *p*ie
`q` - *u*pon - Makes the most common sound in the English alphabet `/…ô‚Äç/` (schwa). Wow, `q` really went from rags to riches.
`r` - *r*otate
`s` - *s*ee
`t` - *t*ie
`√æ` - *th*ink - Makes a soft "th" sound.
`√∞` - *th*is - Makes a voiced "th" sound.
`u` - f*oo*d - *oo*ps - Makes the "oo" sound rather than the `u` sound. This is for consistency with many other languages.
`√º` - b*oo*k
`v` - *v*ase
`w` - *w*hen
`x` - *sh*irt - Why doesn't English have a letter for this sound?
`y` - f*u*n - This is another one of those confusing letters. The old "y" sound is replaced with `√´`.
`z` - *z*oo
`zÃà` - vi*s*ion - This letter is not on keyboards so it's best you type it as `≈æ`. Or you could copy and paste it from the examples below.
